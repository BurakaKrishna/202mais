!Series_summary	"The aim of this study was to establish criteria for carcinogenetic risk estimation in the urothelium. Forty-six samples of non-cancerous urothelium showing no remarkable histological findings obtained from patients with urothelial carcinomas (N), and 46 samples of the corresponding cancerous tissue (T), i.e. 92 tissue samples in total, were analyzed. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed using the Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip."
!Series_overall_design	"Bisulphite converted DNA from the 92 samples were hybridised to the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450K BeadChip."
!Series_type	"Methylation profiling by genome tiling array"
